# Third-party notices

This template uses the following libraries at runtime:

- MIUIX KMP by Yukonga and contributors (`top.yukonga.miuix.kmp`), Apache-2.0.
- AndroidX / Jetpack Compose, under the Apache License 2.0.
- AndroidX WorkManager provides persistent, cancellable song-download tasks (Apache-2.0).
- Jaudiotagger 3.0.1 by JThink / Paul Taylor, Raphael Slinckx and contributors is used under LGPL-2.1-or-later (the LGPL-3.0 option). Unmodified source: https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/net/jthink/jaudiotagger/3.0.1/jaudiotagger-3.0.1-sources.jar. The complete LGPL text is bundled in `legal/LGPL-3.0.txt`. The public application's Gradle source and build instructions allow rebuilding with a modified/replacement library; no library modifications are distributed. The Android artwork adapter is in `core/download/SongDownloadMetadata.kt`.
- Kotlin and kotlinx.coroutines by JetBrains and contributors, Apache-2.0.
- Material Icons by Google, Apache-2.0.
- Player controls use Google's Material Symbols Rounded vectors, Apache-2.0, from
  https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/737e3324305806514d7909874fa1818ae1808232/symbols/android.
  Only the selected 24px XML assets are bundled; their source URLs remain in each resource header.
  The theme-attribute tint is removed so Compose can apply the player's animated tint.
- Coil (including animated image decoders) by Coil contributors, Apache-2.0: https://github.com/coil-kt/coil.
- ZXing QR encoder by ZXing authors, Apache-2.0: https://github.com/zxing/zxing. Copyright 2008 ZXing authors. Used for native login QR generation; the Apache-2.0 license is available offline with the notices.

## Floating Bottom Bar and Liquid Glass

`FloatingBottomBar.kt`, `liquid/{CombinedBackdrop,InnerShadow,Lens,Vibrancy}.kt`, `miuix/animation/{DampedDragAnimation,InteractiveHighlight}.kt` and `miuix/modifier/DragGestureInspector.kt` were ported from the user's local 123PanX / LeiFetch implementation. Package names were adapted for this template; the original attribution headers remain in each file.

The source chain runs through LeiFetch / XBlocker to SukiSU-Ultra v4.1.3 (`0ca744a`), GPL-3.0. The underlying liquid glass examples are derived from compose-miuix-ui/miuix and Kyant0/AndroidLiquidGlass, Apache-2.0. Original copyrights and licenses continue to apply; the combined template remains GPL-3.0-only.

- LeiFetch: https://github.com/bileizhen/LeiFetch
- SukiSU-Ultra: https://github.com/SukiSU-Ultra/SukiSU-Ultra/tree/v4.1.3
- MIUIX examples: https://github.com/compose-miuix-ui/miuix
- Liquid glass helpers: https://github.com/Kyant0/AndroidLiquidGlass

The quantized sensor-light adapter was adapted from 123PanX's `ui/util/TiltLightDirection.kt`, GPL-3.0. It avoids recomposition for insignificant sensor changes.

The Gradle Wrapper is distributed under Apache-2.0. Its generated launch scripts retain their upstream copyright notices.

Full GPL-3.0 and Apache-2.0 texts are packaged in `app/src/main/assets/legal/` and accessible offline from the About page. APK recipients can obtain the corresponding application source and build instructions from the configured GitHub project link.

## Shared settings, About, diagnostic and update UI

The saveable page stack, MIUIX NavDisplay navigation and non-predictive NavigationBackHandler fallback in `ui/CurrentMusicApp.kt` are adapted from local XBlocker `ui/MainActivity.kt`, whose navigation pattern derives from SukiSU-Ultra v4.1.3 (`0ca744a`), GPL-3.0-only. MIUIX owns gesture seeking, cancellation, settling, corner clipping and dimming. Dialogs are hosted once outside navigation entries and retain back-event priority.

The phone theme preview, icon paths, appearance layout, LeiFetch About logo/fade layout, grouped member layout, QQ avatar rows, member dialogs, AnimatedList entry motion and blurred bars, animated About background shaders, bottom dialogs and update Markdown renderer are adapted from the local 123PanX / LeiFetch / XBlocker / SukiSU-Ultra source chain. GPL-3.0-only attribution headers are retained. CurrentMusic branding and product configuration replace application-specific data.

The cancellable HTTPS download and verification helper is adapted from 123PanX `UpdateDownloader.kt`, originally XBlocker `data/AppUpdates.kt`. OkHttp and Okio are used under Apache-2.0. The upstream helper's MIT permission follows:

-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a

writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the

permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be

## AMLL TTML DB lyric data source

The native lyrics engine fetches individual TTML files from AMLL TTML DB,
https://github.com/amll-dev/amll-ttml-db (repository data license: CC0-1.0).
The database is not bundled in the app. Song platform ids, lyric author metadata,
translations, romanization and vocal agents are preserved when parsing.
No AMLL Web Renderer code is included.


## Native NetEase request protocol

The Kotlin web/desktop request encoding and endpoint mappings are adapted from
NeteaseCloudMusicApiEnhanced/api-enhanced, https://github.com/NeteaseCloudMusicApiEnhanced/api-enhanced.
This is a native implementation; the Node.js service is not bundled or required.
